"""
Example showing how to use Qiskit-Terra at level 0 (novice).

This example shows the most basic way to user Terra. It builds some circuits
and runs them on both the BasicAer (local Qiskit provider) or IBMQ (remote IBMQ provider).

To control the compile parameters we have provided a transpile function which can be used 
as a level 1 user.
